        <p>Chess is a board game for two players called (black and white), each controlling the army of chess pieces.
            The army has 16 pieces. Each player takes turns to make a single move, and they can’t choose to skip their
            turn. The players play against each other with the goal of claiming the others’ king piece. One player has
            white pieces, and the other has black pieces to distinguish between who each piece belongs to, the player
            with the white pieces always makes the first move, using a pawn or knight. Kings can move one space
            horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Queens can move to any open square horizontally, vertically, or
            diagonally. Bishops can move to any open square diagonally. Rooks can move to any open square
            horizontally/vertically. Knights move two squares in any direction, and then one to the right or left of
            where it just moved (this piece is also not blocked by other pieces - this is the only piece in the game
            with this ability). Finally, pawns are the most limited piece, being able to move forward only one square
            vertically each time (excluding the first time it moves, the player can choose to move it vertically either
            one square or two squares). This piece also captures other pieces differently - the pawn can only capture
            pieces that are in the two diagonal squares in front of it. When a pawn reaches the other end of the board,
            the player who owns the pawn can choose to turn the pawn into a queen, rook, bishop, or knight, and the
            choice is not limited to already-captured pieces.</p>
